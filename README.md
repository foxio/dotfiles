<3 dotfiles and osx

Installation
------------
the `install.sh` script should install *most* of my enjoyed programs and
applications. If you find you are having problems with an install feel free
to submit an [issue](https://github.com/skj3gg/dotfiles/issues). You will
probably need to enter your password for this.
```
dotfiles|â‡’ (sudo) sh install.sh  # aint nothing but a chicken wing
```

Loading
-------
I am unsure how I want you to handle these yet, but if you know what they
are, I am sure you have an understanding of where they go.

Uninstall :(
------------
Currently there is not an uninstall script but feel free to fork and add one

Attributions
