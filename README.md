<3 dotfiles and osx

Installation
------------
the `install.sh` script should install *most* of my enjoyed programs and
applications. If you find you are having problems with an install feel free
to submit an [issue](https://github.com/skj3gg/dotfiles/issues). You will
need to enter your password for this at the end.

If you include the `all` argument it will install all of the programs in
the list. Otherwise it is a smaller grouping of things I use at work.
```
$ (sudo) sh install.sh (all) # aint nothing but a chicken wing
```

Separation
----------
`install.sh` only combines the other shell scripts in this repository
(besides the `clean_up.sh` and `personalize.sh` scripts), so if you only
want to do part of this install, just run each piece separately.

Uninstall :(

Attributions
------------
The earth, my environment. The people on it, past and present. I love it all!
